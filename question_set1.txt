1.For a given function g(n), we denote by O(g(n)) the set of functions-
A)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= g(n) <= c*f(n) for all n>= n0}

B)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= g(n) <= c*f(n) for all n<= n0}

C)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n>= n0}

D)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n<= n0}

Correct Answer: c

2.For a given function g(n), we denote by Omega(g(n)) the set of functions-
A)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c+g(n) <= f(n)  for all n>= n0}

B)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c+g(n) <= f(n) for all n<= n0}

C)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c*g(n) <= f(n) for all n>= n0}

D)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c*g(n) <= f(n) for all n<= n0}

Correct Answer: c

3.For a given function g(n), we denote by Theta(g(n)) the set of functions-
A)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c1+g(n) <= f(n) <= c2+g(n)  for all n>= n0}

B)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c1+g(n) <= f(n) <= c2+g(n) for all n<= n0}

C)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c1*g(n) <= f(n)<= c2*g(n) for all n>= n0}

D)O(g(n))={f(n): there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 
    0<= c1*g(n) <= f(n)<= c2*g(n) for all n<= n0}

Correct Answer: c
